# politicaLink

This extension allows the user to search a news article for 
the names of relevant journalists, political actors, or organizations,
providing contact information for each target. The generation of an optimal
contact path to important political actors lowers the bar for popular
political engagement and encourages involvement in both local and national
politics.
